# Week 0 Project: Fan Sites and Homepages
You’re going to get comfortable with GitHub, a place where developers store their coding projects. To do that, you’re making your first fansite.

Another aspect of this exercise is to get you used to looking for answers. There is an incredible wealth of coding knowledge out there in the wild, many times you will need to look for a refresher on something you previously learned or will be tackling new unexplored subjects. Trust us, many of your questions have been asked before, a quick google search could save you alot of time and effort!

## Goals
### Personal Goal
- You’ll be able to create your first personal coding projects, visible by the public on GitHub.
- You’ll get comfortable with git and GitHub -- cloning repositories (repos), making changes, and pushing those changes back to GitHub.

### Project Goals
Now, you’ll be making a fan-site, based on this GitHub you're reading now. This fan-site should have the following things:
- There should be a repo on your personal GitHub account named `[YOUR GITHUB USER NAME].github.io`
- If I go to `[YOUR GITHUB USER NAME].github.io`, it should NOT give me a 404 Page ("There isn't a GitHub Pages site here.")
- Edit the `index.html` and `fansite.css` files and use HTML and CSS to replace what’s there with the content about the thing you're, um, fanning over. You’ll commit and push the changes to your GitHub repo.
- If I go to your fansite code at `https://[YOUR GITHUB USER NAME].github.io`, it should have your fansite, not was what was previously there.
  - We have provided a skeleton codebase for you to work with, an HTML page and a CSS page which has been linked to the HTML page in the header.
  - Remember, assigning `id` and `class` to your HTML elements is how you connect those specific elements to the CSS rules you make in your CSS file.
  - The order of your HTML matters, so remember to structure your page the way you want it to look.

Here are some links to resources and a few tips to help you with this project:

- Creating a new Repo from a cloned one - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6034904/how-to-create-a-new-repository-which-is-a-clone-of-another-repository
- Pushing your code up to your GitHub Repo - https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line
- HTML Element Reference - https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp
- CSS Attribute Reference - https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp
- GitHub Pages - https://pages.github.com/ 
- Keep it simple, this is just to get your feet wet with some coding, we will be covering all of these concepts during week 1 and there will be a lot of practice.
- Happy coding! Feel free to reach out on slack if you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask for help!

## Notes
- We use GitHub a lot here, inside and outside Wyncode. If many people work on the same project, we use GitHub to communicate. [Many open-source projects](https://github.com/open-source) use GitHub as well. 
- There may be a situation where you make changes to files on GitHub Pages may take some time for it to appear if you go to the URL on GitHub. This is because of something GitHub does [called caching](https://www.dynadot.com/community/help/question/what-is-cached-website).
- You'll be adding a `README.md` file on all of the projects you do. Trust me, you-in-two-years will thank you for it.
